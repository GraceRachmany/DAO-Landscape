# Foreword

> The experiment started in Berlin as an entrepreneur. Not a researcher as well, but done a lot of market analysis, that I did with mapping. Come from sharing economy, platform coops. Through Ela, started to work with rchain/dgov. Besides, that was researching 50-60 providers from the map, the goal was in identifying challenges and how to integrate them in the ecosystem. Would like to continue with that proposal. The only question is to what degree dgov~DAO are related. Dgov are the tools for organizing people, the step before DAO. You need some rules at the start. Maybe that’s one component of the research.

Andreas Arnold, RChain Europe

> In thinking about DAOs and a post-competitive environment, one of the first most obvious projects is creating a shared body of knowledge and point of references. Sharing what we know, what we’ve done, what has worked and what has failed is one of the most basic foundations for research. In overly competitive environments \(traditional industries\), best practices are secret, leveraged to get an advantage over one another. DAO thinking is different. We are interested in using our collective intelligence to progress further, faster, and for the benefit of all of us. My background is in communications, team collaboration, writing, and systems thinking. The first step I took in this body of knowledge was to research if such a thing had been done before, and to speculate on how we might design a search engine for DAO proposals, so that we can have a collective history of what has been done across the industry.

Grace Rachmany, DAO Leadership

> Very VUCA, Occupy movement veteran and other movements. Used to conflict. Interested in creating cybernetics relations, what we create here is super linked. Have some drafts. Let’s imagine all info on blockchain was collected in the space form / orbits \(can send more info\). Would be very important to see knowledge, so other people can get the info in a visual way.

Felipe Duarte, Org consultant, DAO Stack

> Collecting and systematizing the info helps seeing patterns, building solid knowledge foundation for any work in the space. Lacking this essential infrastructure can drive us into endless argument about facts,

Max Semenchuk, Dgov Foundation, DAO incubator

> Feel the need to give some context. Now blockchain researcher in R&D / Applied research, part of Genesis DAO since inception. Worked with NGOs on multiple areas. Most interested in decentralized knowledge production and reducing information asymmetry.
