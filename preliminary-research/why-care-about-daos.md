# Why care about DAOs?

Anja Blaj, \[08.05.19 15:11\] \[In reply to Max Semenchuk \| DGOV & 4IRE labs\] I find this article about a “future organisations” informative: [https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/organization-of-the-future.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/organization-of-the-future.html)

Pat \| DAOstack, \[08.05.19 15:14\] \[In reply to Max Semenchuk \| DGOV & 4IRE labs\] Extremist response: Climate change will kill us all if we don't organize better.

Pat \| DAOstack, \[08.05.19 15:15\] Moderate response: Because corporations are blood-sucking state-capturing profit motivated machines determined to bury us with wage slavery

Phoebe Tickell, \[08.05.19 15:15\] In that statement lies another statement beforehand: "DAOs allow us to organize better".

Pedro Parrachia, \[08.05.19 15:15\] \[In reply to Anja Blaj\] nice one! thanks for the article

Stacco Troncoso, \[08.05.19 15:15\] \[In reply to Max Semenchuk \| DGOV & 4IRE labs\] They can lower the transactional cost of self-organized alternatives and the maintenance of commons. Devil's in the details.

Pat \| DAOstack, \[08.05.19 15:16\] Light-hearted response: because magic internet money is fun

Sebastian, \[08.05.19 15:17\] This article by Cohan might help [https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=874121115073065002015115115111083029117043064003031030025127073026002089014105115122122049008101104109008000027073023116065112040060087061002004004020112069123109072057062022125014021085094064025010101106024001116093073021019029080016023075123006004105&EXT=pdf](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=874121115073065002015115115111083029117043064003031030025127073026002089014105115122122049008101104109008000027073023116065112040060087061002004004020112069123109072057062022125014021085094064025010101106024001116093073021019029080016023075123006004105&EXT=pdf)

PhilH, \[08.05.19 15:18\] for both Jordan's interview and the comment below. About anti-rivalry, and the commons as well

Phoebe Tickell, \[08.05.19 15:19\] \[In reply to Stacco Troncoso\] I agree with Stacco. There are many different strategies to organise in a way that enables P2P / commons / antirivalry - but DAOs could offer an efficient way to self-organise resources. Though we need them to work legally!

Stacco Troncoso, \[08.05.19 15:21\] Legislation often follows "vernacular law" and lived experienced precedents. Customs = law. And yeah, it also needs pilots

Griff Green, \[08.05.19 15:25\] \[In reply to Max Semenchuk \| DGOV & 4IRE labs\] DAOs have to the potential to align incentives in ways not possible without them... but as @staccop2p says... devil is in the details... and i dont think we have figured out how to do dgov well... its going to take time and practice...

Stacco Troncoso, \[08.05.19 15:26\] There's also the question of "we". Who's we? The various values in this group or those behind the blockchain developments in HSBC or IBM?

Stacco Troncoso, \[08.05.19 15:27\] Here's an article from Primavera from 2014, still very relevant: [https://www.guerrillatranslation.es/2015/05/13/ethereum-freenet-o-skynet/](https://www.guerrillatranslation.es/2015/05/13/ethereum-freenet-o-skynet/)

Max Semenchuk \| DGOV & 4IRE labs, \[08.05.19 15:28\] Thanks so much, am including this in the DAO landscape report

Griff Green, \[08.05.19 15:28\] @bradlyc and crew made a really interesting project at ETHCapetown called DAO vs DAO where governance models could compete in games... and i think it brings light to an interesting issue... Could any DAO governance model that exists beat a Benevelent Dictator in Chess?

Griff Green, \[08.05.19 15:28\] I'm going to go with no way...

Griff Green, \[08.05.19 15:28\] but i do think we will be able to get there eventually

Stacco Troncoso, \[08.05.19 15:29\] \[In reply to Stacco Troncoso\] Ooops, that's the Spanish translation, sorry. Here's the English transcript: [https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/2014/11/20/ethereum-freenet-or-skynet/](https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/2014/11/20/ethereum-freenet-or-skynet/)

## What is DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\)?

DAO is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do \[[Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\].

DAO means ownership + DGov system. \(Matan Field, in COALA conversations\)

DAO is corporation running on the digital jurisdiction. \(Yalda, EthCC presentation\)

A DAO can be seen as the most complex form of a smart contract, where the bylaws of the decentralized organization are embedded into the code of the smart contract, using complex token governance rules. \([Blockchain Hub](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/)\)

The DAO was an organization that was designed to be automated and decentralized. \([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/)\)

DAO is a fancy way of saying a digital system living on Ethereum. \([Richard Burton, Balance](https://medium.com/balance-io/why-open-source-finance-will-win-a1f3a61544c2)\)

DAO is a composition of smart contracts running on the underlying permissionless blockchain \(e.g. Ethereum\) to form an organisation infrastructure. \(Tim Bansemer\).

DAO – An organization that runs autonomously, in a decentralized manner, that functions without the need for centralized parties to make decisions for the organization to grow, to be profitable, or \*physically\* exist to serve its overall purpose. A DAO can be an on-chain contract, or a series of on-chain contracts that interoperate to complete some greater organizational function. \([Steven McKie](https://medium.com/amentum/the-year-of-the-dao-comeback-9c888b44980)\)

DAC \(Decentralized autonomous corporations/companies\) are a smaller topic, because they are basically a subclass of DAOs, but they are worth mentioning. Since the main exponent of DAC as terminology is Daniel Larimer, we will borrow as a definition the point that he himself consistently promotes: a DAC pays dividends \[[source](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\].

**A.\) Answered by @joshmzemel \[DAOstack Communications\]:**

In the broadest sense, the use case for DAOstack is any time there is a need to coordinate a large group of people to make decisions collectively. So, to imagine various specific cases, we can imagine a few different types of decisions a group might need to make.

1. Collaboration to Produce an Outcome \(“Work”\)

In cases where the goal is to develop or deliver products and services – roughly speaking, a decentralized ‘company’ – the decisions often concern how to value individual contributions, and how to budget for work and other purchases. What projects should be funded? How much should so-and-so be paid for that article, or that software upgrade? What will be the process for verifying and evaluating work? Should the organization invest in this or that office space, or legal support, or PR firm? Examples include:

A film project of 1,000 artists  
An open-source software project of 10,000 developers  
A climate initiative of 50,000 scientists  
A collaborative news network of 100,000 journalists

1. Asset Management

These types of collectives make decisions primarily about the management of assets and the allocation of funds. Should we invest in this project, or property? Should we pay out this or that claim? Should we sell this or that asset? Examples include decentralized versions of:

Venture funds  
Insurance networks  
Charitable funds  
Pension funds  
Real estate investment collectives

1. Curation

Curation networks leverage the wisdom of the crowd to rank the subjective quality of objects. What content should be featured in the feed or the newsletter? How trustworthy is this company? How good is the food at this place? Examples include decentralized versions of:

Restaurant or hotel guides, similar to Yelp or TripAdvisor  
Article or video feeds, akin social news feeds or Reddit  
Website listings, like a socially curated Google search

1. All of the Above

In practice, many DAOs will include decision-making in more than one category. An open-source software project, in addition to rewarding its contributors \(case 1\), might collectively curate what code will be included in each release, or featured in its newsletter \(3\). Conversely, a social network, in addition to curating content \(3\), has a business to run, and must pay its developers, marketers, legal personnel, and so on \(1\). And either organization might want to invest the proceeds from their activities into other projects \(2\).

**@dylanschwartz followed up with:** _**"What sort of decisions can we make as a majority that cannot be better made by a few highly intelligent, well educated, rational thinkers?"**_

Good questions – couple of answers.

1. Leaving decision-making up to only a few people centralizes power and exposes the system to concentrated points of failure, bad influence, etc.
2. Effective systems for decentralized governance do need to account for the disparities in expertise and qualification to make decisions. DAOstack includes reputation management systems to help determine how to weigh votes in decision-making. So, it might the case effectively that certain decisions are carried out by only a few individuals who have particularly high reputation \(voting power\) in a given organization. But even then, that voting power is fluid – able to be redistributed according to their performance as evaluated by the wisdom of the crowd. It’s not fixed power by virtue of title or position.
