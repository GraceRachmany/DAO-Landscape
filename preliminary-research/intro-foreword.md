# Intro / Foreword

## Why we started it

Purpose: knowledge for to-be-DAOs \(e.g. best practices on things like proposal making\)

#### Grace / how we started that

Was researching it, Pedro was looking on that for longer, then Ela. Pat became interested from the other POV – let’s see what already done. My goal was search engine about all proposals in the dgov, DAO space. Maybe somebody on DASH did it \(and failed\). E.g. topics on identity, voting. Pat was interested in the spreadsheet of DAOs and what they use \(e.g. voting, legal model etc\). Good in org design and interviewing.

#### Andreas

The experiment started in Berlin as an entrepreneur. Not a researcher as well, but done a lot of market analysis, that I did with mapping. Come from sharing economy, platform coops. Through Ela, started to work with rchain/dgov. Besides, that was researching 50-60 providers from the map, the goal was in identifying challenges and how to integrate them in the ecosystem. Would like to continue with that proposal. The only question is to what degree dgov~DAO are related. Dgov are the tools for organizing people, the step before DAO. You need some rules at the start. Maybe that’s one component of the research.

#### Pedro

Feel the need to give some context. Now blockchain researcher in R&D / Applied research, part of Genesis DAO since inception. Worked with NGOs on multiple areas. Most interested in knowledge production – trying to help somehow another attempt in the research DAO \(Matan tried to launch\). It didn’t really happen, there were talks with EF and other entities about more agnostic initiative. That would be an amazing step to that. Invited Felipe. Remembered [https://viz.envisioning.io/democracy/?o=2](https://viz.envisioning.io/democracy/?o=2) – maybe a useful tool

#### Felipe

Org consultant, as Phoebe, in Brazil. Very VUCA, Occupy movement veteran and other movements. Used to conflict. Am a painter and artists. Interested in creating cybernetics relations, what we create here is super linked. Have some drafts. Let’s imagine all info on blockchain was collected in the space form / orbits \(can send more info\). Would be very important to see knowledge, so other people can get the info in a visual way. Have beedn in Asia, coming back in 2 weeks, let’s hangout. Am DAO stack team comms & community. Finishing the book. Reading “Walkway” – blows my mind.  


#### Max

Dgov, dao incubator. A book before the conference. Understanding what’s happening
