# Strategy

Purpose: Improve the efficiency of the network governance through the research



* How should we govern networks \(e.g. Ethereum\)? Principles of decentralization, \(crypto\)law, self-organization etc
* What tools produce best results? On-chain + soft practices, decision making, execution, dispute resolution, radical markets etc
* How are current networks governed. Upsides and downsides of different gogvernance models. Update the Governance family tree: Ethereum, MakerDAO, Cardano, Grin, Bitcoin, Polkdadot, Cosmos, Decred, MolochDAO  governance case studies. Development on existent governance case studies though deeper analytics and interviews with network stakeholders.
* What are most relevant problems for networks
* Decreasing the governance costs \(0%\)
* Making better decisions
* Funding public goods
* Increasing the amount and quality of interactions
* Improve org experience
* How to make collaborative strategies
* Dgov Adoption
* Research: Increase the probability and speed of consensus on protocol changes
  * Identifying the tensions
  * Creating proposals
  * Collecting the signals on the proposals
  * Presenting

DAOs 

* Is it better? when?
* What can be automated? What should be automated?
* What is hardcoded, what is in templates?
* How to make it better?
* How to raise more awareness and adoption?
* How to incentivize people to collaborate, rather then fork-off? How to overcome our competitive nature?
* What would the onboarding process will look like? How to make it easy? \(rather wrong and easy, than hard\)
* How to make this applicable for humans? – Grace works
* How to optimize the process of proposing? – Grace works
* How do we get the best, most inclusive solutions and honor everybody in the process? – Grace works
* How do we stop thinking in "either/or" way?



## Networks Foundations

Network Foundations \(Ethereum Foundation, Internet Foundation, Decentralized Identity Foundation\). Network is a type of organization focused on connecting members for collaboration and opportunities exchange.

* Conduct researches on [the topics]()
* Research: Funding public goods
* Partner with [ISSDG](https://issdg.org/)
