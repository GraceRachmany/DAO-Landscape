# About

This is a collaborative research on Networks, Commons, Distributed Governance, DAOs, Smart Organizations, Digital cooperatives and overall digitalization of organizations. It contains technologies, case studies, frameworks etc. The purpose is to setup the base knowledge for the field, outline best practices and find the interoperability gaps.

Work is in progress with no final state – to be constantly updated and changed. Feel free to contribute with pull requests by clicking on the "edit on Github" button. [**Join the discussion!**](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/case-study-research/90)\*\*\*\*

Additional questions:

* How should we govern networks \(e.g. Ethereum\)? Principles of decentralization, \(crypto\)law, self-organization etc
* What tools produce best results? On-chain + soft practices, decision making, execution, dispute resolution, radical markets etc
* How are current networks governed. Upsides and downsides of different gogvernance models. Update the Governance family tree: Ethereum, MakerDAO, Cardano, Grin, Bitcoin, Polkdadot, Cosmos, Decred, MolochDAO  governance case studies. Development on existent governance case studies though deeper analytics and interviews with network stakeholders.
* What are most relevant problems for networks
* Decreasing the governance costs \(0%\)
* Making better decisions
* Funding public goods
* Increasing the amount and quality of interactions
* Improve org experience
* How to make collaborative strategies
* Dgov Adoption
* Research: Increase the probability and speed of consensus on protocol changes
  * Identifying the tensions
  * Creating proposals
  * Collecting the signals on the proposals
  * Presenting
