### Purpose

[Digital Cash, peer-to-peer digital currency.](https://www.dash.org/learning-resources/)

### History & key events

* January 2014 launched as "Xcoin"
* Rebranded to Darkcoin \(2015\) and then Dash \(2016\)
* February 2018, [a legal entity was formed which represents the DAO, and this entity took ownership of Dash Core](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-core-group-becomes-first-legally-dao-owned-entity/)

### Objects of governance & Used mechanics 

#### Masternodes

[Masternode Operators \(MNOs\) are key actors in the Dash network. ](https://medium.com/@richardred/observations-of-the-dash-treasury-dao-c94231b2b5c4)Dash Masternodes \(MNs\) provide certain services \(InstantSend and PrivateSend\) to users, receive 45% of the block reward, and collectively control the project’s development fund through voting. A MNO can operate multiple MNs.

#### Treasury

Each month, DASH dispenses 10% of the block rewards for that month in a superblock. This DASH is distributed to the wallets associated with treasury budget proposals which have scored highly enough to receive a payout. MNOs vote Yes, No or Abstain to proposals, on the basis of one vote per MN. Money is available by default, not allocated budget coins are not minted.

#### Funds distribution

There is a [voting threshold which determines whether a proposal will be funded](https://docs.dash.org/en/latest/governance.html#budgets-and-masternode-voting): a net Yes vote greater than 10% of all MNs. The threshold formula is: \(YES votes — NO votes\) &gt; \(Total Number of Masternodes / 10\). Formal submission of a proposal costs a fee of 5 DASH.
