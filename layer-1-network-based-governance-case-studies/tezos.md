### Purpose

Tezos is a self-amending blockchain network which incorporates a formal, on-chain mechanism for proposing, selecting, testing, and activating protocol upgrades without the need to hard fork. Operates under liquid PoS consensus.

### History & key events

Upgrades to the protocol through proposal & voting process. Uses min quorum adapted to the average participation and and 80% of supermajority support level to pass.

* Developers independently submit proposals for protocol upgrades and request for compensation for their work.
* The request for compensation makes sure that the developers have a strong economic incentive to contribute to the ecosystem
* The proposal goes through a testing period wherein the community tests the protocol and criticizes it for possible improvements.
* After repeated testing, the Tezos token holders can then vote on whether the proposal should be approved or not.
* Once a legitimate upgrade is decided on, a “hot swap” occurs on the protocol, which initiates the new version of the protocol.

### Network Stats \(on April 2019\)

* [Market cap $0.79B](https://messari.io/asset/tezos)
* 460 bakers \(analogue of block validators\)
* 106 public delegates \(who you can delegate your XTZ tokens if you have less then 10k\)
