# On-chain Governance Case Studies

We need to make a lot of experiments and thoroughly document them in order to find a working formula for the on-chain governance. This research is dedicated to collect, categorize and compare different attempts in governance automation and scaling with blockchain systems.

Work is in progress with no final state – to be constantly updated and changed \(feel free to do pull requests\). [Discussion](https://daotalk.org/t/case-studies-decentralized-orgs-with-on-chain-governance/395) happens on the forum.
